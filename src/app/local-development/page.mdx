}

# Local Development
Run Lua on your local machine for development purposes.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.1 or later
- Composer
- Node.js with npm
- MySQL

If you prefer working with Docker instead of installing PHP and MySQL locally, you can use [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail).

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luadotsh/lua.git
cd lua
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Choose one of the following methods:

#### Option 1: Without Sail (Local PHP Installation)
```bash
composer install
```

#### Option 2: With Sail (Docker)
```bash
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php82-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```
Then, start the project:
```bash
vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

---

## 3. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Update your `.env` file with database and app settings.

---

## 4. Run migrations and seed the database
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
> **🛠️ Using Sail?**  
> If you're running Laravel with Sail, prefix commands with `sail`, like this:
> ```bash
> vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
> ```

---

## 5. Run the front-end build
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 6. Running with Reverb
```bash
php artisan reverb:start --host="0.0.0.0" --port=8080 --hostname="lua.sh.test"
```
> **Using Sail?** Run:  
> ```bash
> vendor/bin/sail artisan reverb:start --host="0.0.0.0" --port=8080 --hostname="lua.sh.test"
> ```

---

## Summary of Running Commands with Sail
Once Sail is running (`vendor/bin/sail up -d`), use it for all Laravel commands:
```bash
vendor/bin/sail artisan {command}
```

---

This guide ensures a clear, easy-to-follow installation process for both **traditional local setups** and **Docker-based Laravel Sail environments**. 🚀
